# CashFlow

This project originated from the seminar on [*Advanced Blockchain Technologies*](https://www.in.tum.de/i13/teaching/winter-semester-201920/advanced-seminar-blockchain-technologies/) (IN2107) at the Technical University of Munich. Within the scope of this course, we analyzed the technical characteristics, advantages as well as limitations of Hyperledger Fabric thoroughly, and proposed a proof-of-concept for a given use case.
